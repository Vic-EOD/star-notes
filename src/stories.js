    situation:
      "Team needed a Tech Analyst to become comfortable with the Environmental aspect of ESG in order to help clients such as Costco and Capital Group develop solutions",
    task: "My goal was to become familiar with environmental terms and methodologies specific to clients to better understand the customer when working with their solutions",
    action:
      "I set up a workshop to better understand environmental topics as well as organized a Hackathon centered on ESG to help the company as well as myself become more adept at creating environmental solutions for our customers",
    result:
      "We signed several major contracts with customers including Costco, Nike and Starbucks as well as securing several deals for demos and pilots delivering the firm an increase of x% year over year in ESG sales as well as an x% increase in annual recurring revenue",

    title: "Title 2",
    situation:
      "We had to develop an application for a client that could create, track , and report on ESG surveys. The goal was to have baseline surveys for tracking current sentiment and status on key issues followed by a more thorough survey for goals and commitments.",
    task: "We had to develop the model and choose the platform that the application would be built on. Our main options were Power Platform or a web application. I made the choice to go with a web application to make the tool more agnostic and extendable as well as to avoid licensing and data ownership issues.",
    action:
      "I faced resistance but I disagreed and committed to my choice and explained that by going this route we would have more options every step of the way instead of being painted into a circle with the Power Platform. ",
    result:
      "We ended up going this route and as a result we were able to turn the tool into a more balanced survey platform where we could better extend functionality as well as topics and areas of interest. We had better choices for databases, UI, reporting, and even developer support allowing us to have better long term results. In the end we built a system that was capable of handling additional surveys and survey types like IT and supply chain as well as letting clients develop templates for custom surveys. This resulted in a 5x opportunity increase on day 1 compared to the Power Platform option.",

    title: "Title 3",
    situation:
      "Costco had seen an initial presentation and thought that our strategies were not clear enough to understand at a glance.",
    task: "Our task was to make our strategies more explicit and defined in the front end while still abstracting unnecessary information. This would allow us to better align our solution to the client's wants and needs and give us a better chance to win a contract for a pilot.",
    action:
      "We had an internal disagreement on the team between two individuals on how we were going to move forward with the feedback we received. One of our options was to show more data to the client and strategy builders and give them more control over that data. This would introduce unnecessary noise to the application and possibly make the strategies more confusing. The other option was to strip down the strategies and make them simple to understand from the front end with only important KPIs. I chose to split the difference and introduce an additional details page for every strategy while simplifying the original strategy page to only include key metrics and KPIs.",
    result:
      "The change was well received by Costco who loved the idea of having different views for different levels of their decision making and implementation teams. Executives can see the impact of the strategies at a glance while the strategy creation team can dive deep into the data and mechanics of the strategies. This allowed our team to sign a deal for a pilot program with Costco, a huge win for our team.",
