# Star Notes

Star Notes is an application for writing down stories and responses to behavioral-based interview questions using the STAR method. STAR stands for Situation, Task, Action, and Result.

- **Situation** - Describe the situation you were in or the task that you need to accomplish.
- **Task** - What goal were you working toward?
- **Action** - Describe the actions that you took to address the situation with an apppropriate amount of detail and keep the focus on YOU.
- **Result** - Describe the outcome of your actions and don't be shy about taking credit for your behavior.
